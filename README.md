# emotion-detection
This Java-based project uses OpenCV for face detection, recognition, and emotion analysis. It detects faces from images or video, recognizes known faces, and analyzes emotions. If unrecognized, it prompts for details and stores them in a MySQL database using JDBC. The system combines facial recognition, emotion detection, and database integration.
